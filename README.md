A cryptocurrency is any kind of peer-to-peer digital money powered by the Blockchain technology. Since Bitcoin's appearance in 2009, hundreds of new cryptocurrencies (often called altcoins) have been created, all of which offer different advantages and disadvantages compared to Bitcoin. The Blockchain itself is based on the principles of cryptography, hence the name "cryptocurrencies". In 2017, the popularity of cryptocurrency increased and there was an exponential rise in Bitcoin prices. There has been a recent downturn, but most investors are eager to see how they rebound and continue to mature. Since this new form of currency was a recently trending topic, we decided to focus on a dataset that told us how the value of cryptocurrencies changed over time.

This is a D3 project that uses the ‘Cryptocoins Historical Prices’ dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/valeriovaccaro/cryptocoinshistoricalprices/data . The dataset had more than 1,000 different cryptocurrencies on a daily level from 2013 to 2018. The project is focused on the ‘Open’, ‘High’, ‘Low’ and ‘Close’ values of the 6 most popular ones – ‘BITBTC’ (bitBTC), ‘BTC’ (Bitcoin), ‘DASH’, ‘ETH’ (Ethereum), ‘LTC’ (Litecoin) and ‘XRP’ (Ripple).
